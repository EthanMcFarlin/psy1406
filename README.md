Team Members: 

- Andrew Byun, Julia Casas, Ethan McFarlin, and Claire Suen

Instructions on Grading:

- (1) We worked with 3 separate Google Collab scripts, passing input images from different dataasets into each. They are sub-divided into respective folders according to our research questions.

- (2) Rather than answering Questions 4-6 in each independent Google Collab document, we consolidated our answers in the form of a [single Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q-LZzL94dA5uACQC7PalbgjqSfxH1rRScgKChGKe5qw/edit?usp=sharing). The document was then exported as a PDF and is included in this repo.

- (3) Our PowerPoint has been exported as a .pptx and is located in this repo.

- (4) All the local files needed to run the Google collab scripts (i.e. input images) are included in the respective sub-folders of this repository. 

- (5) Statstical analysis was carried out in R and Python.
